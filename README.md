### Hello & Bonjour! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CI validation work for the ICARUS experiment at Fermilab!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning git, docker, and apptainer for this work.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on neutrino physics research, relevant software, and industry applications.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with git projects that teach the basics as they apply to large collaborations!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: one of the smallest frogs, the Pumpkin Toadlet, is known for its [comic inability to land upright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcaYhzBGwkI&ab_channel=NowThisImpact)!
